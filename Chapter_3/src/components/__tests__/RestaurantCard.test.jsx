/* ðŸ’¡NOTE:
        - when we test component that has props then do this:

            1. first copy the data that you have passed in the props by console.log the data.

            2. then inside the components folder creates a folder and name it "mocks" and inside that create a "json" file and paste the data
            
            3. then pass that data here in the component
