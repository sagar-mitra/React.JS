## üìö Difference between a Library and Framework?
Both libraries and frameworks are reusable code written by someone else. Their purpose is to help you solve common problems in easier ways.

### Libraries:
A library is a collection of pre-written code that you can use to perform specific tasks. Libraries are often used to reduce the amount of code a programmer needs to write by providing reusable functions or classes that can be called upon as needed.

### Frameworks:
A framework is a set of libraries or tools that provide a structure for building applications. It typically includes code
libraries templates, and guidelines for how to use the libraries to develop applications.
Frameworks can be useful for developers because they provide a standardized way to build and organize code,
which can help streamline the development process and make it easier to build and maintain complex applications. They can also help developers to build applications that are more reliable and scalable, as the framework provides a set of best practices and conventions to follow.

## üåê What is CDN? Why do we use it?
A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications. CDN can stand for content delivery network or content distribution network. When a user visits a website, data from that website's server has to travel across the internet to reach the user's computer. If the user is located far from that server, it will take a long time to load a large file, such as a video or website image. Instead, the website content is stored on CDN servers geographically closer to the users and reaches their computers much faster.

### Importance:
Content delivery networks (CDNs) provide many benefits that improve website performance and support core network infrastructure. For example, a CDN can do the following tasks:

- **Reduce page load time**: 
Website traffic can decrease if your page load times are too slow. A CDN can reduce bounce rates and increase the time users spend on your site.

- **Reduce bandwidth costs**: 
Bandwidth costs are a significant expense because every incoming website request consumes network bandwidth. Through caching and other optimizations, CDNs can reduce the amount of data an origin server must provide, reducing the costs of hosting for website owners.

- **Increase content availability**: 
Too many visitors at one time or network hardware failures can cause a website to crash. CDN services can handle more web traffic and reduce the load on web servers. Also, if one or more CDN servers go offline, other operational servers can replace them to ensure uninterrupted service.

- **Improve website security**: 
Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks attempt to take down applications by sending large amounts of fake traffic to the website. CDNs can handle such traffic spikes by distributing the load between several intermediary servers, reducing the impact on the origin server.

## ‚öõÔ∏è Why is React known as React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, that was developed by Facebook. It was originally released in 2013 and has since become one of the most popular libraries for building web applications.

It was developed by Facebook, and the name ‚ÄúReact‚Äù was chosen because it is meant to help developers build user interfaces that are fast and responsive, or ‚Äúreactive.‚Äù The library was designed to ‚Äúreact‚Äù to changes in data.

When data in a React application changes, the components that depend on that data are automatically updated, which allows for efficient and seamless updates to the user interface. The name ‚ÄúReact‚Äù reflects this reactive nature of the library.

## üõ°Ô∏è What is crossorigin in script tag?
``` html
<script crossorigin src="..."></script>
```
The `crossorigin` attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.

Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in.

A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.

CORS is used to manage cross-origin requests.
